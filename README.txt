README.TXTFor my tutorial, I decided to work on a tutorial for building games in android. The tutorial started with building the loading screen class. This class displays the loading message and then redirects to the GameScreen. From there, we call all these constructors in the Sample Game section. Finally, I added picture functionality so that it displays a picture to the screen when the game starts. I tried implementing a menu but didn’t get to that point yet. We didn’t want to start implementing the actual menu without consulting first.
